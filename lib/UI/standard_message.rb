                Instructions:

                The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
                You are X, your opponent is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
                The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
                If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is over.
